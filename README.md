# Simple-Neuron -Built neural networks as a game

-- The simplest way for creating neural networks directly in your computer
-- Currently we are only supporting .netframework6

I might not be avialable as my schedule is very tight.
Please support this product for being available for other people simply;

     We are working on creating this for
        -# Convolutional Neural Network
        -# Recurrent Neural Networks |LSTM
                                     |GRU
                                     |RNN
        -# Genetic Programming
        -# Support Vector Machines
        -# Generative adversarial networks
        
# How to use
    -> First input features,hidden layers,outputs,No of epochs
    -> Then Input Data's from -1,....,1 (Training input,output);
    -> Then Run the model for specific amount of time
    -> Then Evaluate by inputting data and see output
